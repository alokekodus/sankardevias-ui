                <p class="fw-bold">Sankardev IAS Academy</p>

                <p>This is the age of competition and in the age of competition only the fit one will survive. The
                    North-East India, especially the state of Assam has witnessed lots of agitation and insurgency for
                    decade where the student community are the most sufferer. To establish rights and bring a positive
                    revolution to the society the only path is through entering into policy making. Executives in India
                    are considered to be one of the three pillars of the constitution and they are the one who draft all
                    kind of policies. The numbers of executive (IAS, IPS etc.) from Assam and North-East are relatively
                    low in comparison to the rest of the country and this is because these states are lacking a proper
                    competitive environment and guidance. Students need to move to Delhi for a better coaching and
                    guidance, which is not affordable for all. Sankardev IAS Academy is bringing these facilities to the
                    doorsteps of the student community of Assam and North East at a very affordable cost.</p>

                <p>Sankardev IAS Academy is a place for them who has an Aim and can give sleepless effort for achieving
                    their dream. We want a movement among the students and parent community of Assam for civil service
                    examination and Vivekananda Civil Service Academy will be the epicenter for this movement.</p>

                <p>The aim of Sankardev IAS Academy is not only to coach the student for civil service examination but
                    also to build a good citizen at the end, so that s/he can deliver the best to the society and the
                    community get benefited. The Faculties are one of the best faculties hired from Delhi who have 10 to
                    15 years of proven experience of producing several civil servants. The coaching programme also
                    includes residential programme where students can stay in hostel, avail 24X7 library facility and
                    access the faculties who will lodge in the academy’s guest house. This place is for all the aspiring
                    students; we will provide necessary helping hands to the economically weaker students who has a zeal
                    to become a civil servant and a good citizen.</p>

                <p>I hereby appeal to the students and their parent community to join this movement for civil service.
